My name is Fabian. I am 20 years old and I am from Stuttgart. I speak German, English and French. At the university in Stuttgart I study French to become a teacher later. In my free time I like to meet my friends, go to the cinema or like to ride a bike. I have no siblings and no pets, but I still live at home with my parents.
